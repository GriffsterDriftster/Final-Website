      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
      <ul style="margin-top:0.5rem; margin-bottom:1.5rem; padding-left:1.25rem; list-style:disc;">
        <li>Sixty‑four percent of business owners say AI will be essential to stay competitive in the next few years, yet only about a quarter are using it across multiple areas【891782546097375†L127-L148】.</li>
        <li>Just 22&nbsp;% of organisations have a visible AI strategy; those that do are twice as likely to see revenue growth and 3.5&nbsp;times more likely to realise critical benefits【882462728029115†L442-L466】.</li>
        <li>Delaying investment means missing out on efficiency gains, faster decision making and competitive advantages.</li>
        <li>Building an AI roadmap today helps mitigate risks and ensures you’re ready for the next wave of innovation.</li>

        <h2 style="font-family:'DM Serif Display', serif; font-size:1.8rem;">Adoption trends & stats</h2>
        <p>The AI landscape in the U.S. is growing rapidly. A survey of business owners found that 64&nbsp;% believe adopting AI will be essential to remain competitive over the next three to five years【891782546097375†L127-L148】. Despite this urgency, only 26&nbsp;% are actively using AI across multiple areas of their business【891782546097375†L127-L148】. Cash‑flow concerns and uncertainty about use cases are common reasons for delay, even though operational efficiency is the top objective for 34&nbsp;% of respondents【891782546097375†L127-L148】.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="strategy">
        <h2 style="font-family:'DM Serif Display', serif; font-size:1.8rem;">Why a strategy matters</h2>
        <p>Having a clear AI strategy is a strong predictor of success. In the Thomson Reuters Future of Professionals report, organisations with a visible AI strategy were twice as likely to see revenue growth and 3.5&nbsp;times more likely to realise critical benefits from AI【882462728029115†L442-L466】. Yet only 22&nbsp;% of organisations surveyed have such a strategy in place【882462728029115†L442-L466】.</p>
        <p>The same report notes that professionals expect AI tools to save them about five hours per week over the next year — worth approximately $19&nbsp;000 per person — and that AI could unlock a $32&nbsp;billion opportunity in the U.S. legal and tax sectors【882462728029115†L442-L466】. These are tangible benefits available to early adopters.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="risks">
        <h2 style="font-family:'DM Serif Display', serif; font-size:1.8rem;">The cost of falling behind</h2>
        <p>Waiting to adopt AI comes with risks. Competitors who integrate AI into their workflows will deliver faster responses, more personalised experiences and lower operating costs. Organisations without an AI roadmap risk being perceived as outdated and may struggle to attract both customers and talent.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, as generative AI models improve, the gap between those who have invested and those who have not will widen. The skills and data infrastructure required to support AI can’t be built overnight. Businesses that delay may find themselves scrambling to catch up, potentially incurring higher costs to adopt later and missing opportunities to experiment safely.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="next-steps">
        <h2 style="font-family:'DM Serif Display', serif; font-size:1.8rem;">Next steps</h2>
        <p>To stay ahead, start by identifying areas where AI can deliver quick wins — customer support, scheduling, document analysis or basic analytics. Create a roadmap that prioritises projects based on impact and complexity. Engage experts who can help you navigate ethical considerations, data privacy and change management.</p>
        <p>Finally, commit to continuous learning. The AI landscape is evolving fast, and staying informed will help you identify new opportunities and adapt your strategy. The costs of doing nothing far outweigh the investment required to get started.</p>
